<h2>User Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to change, with or without notice, any rank price that has been set forth. We also reserve the right to change the contents of a specific rank - the benefits of a certain rank can change, and you will not be entitled to the old rank benefits if we change it. Rest assured that no rank benefit, or any other item in the store, will be changed without a valid, server-balancing reason. We reserve the right, with the appropriate permissions, to forcibly make you leave the server, permanently or temporarily, with no chance of refund - however this will never be unwarranted, this will only happen in the case of extreme rule-breaking. If you obey the rules, you will never be banned, plain and simple.
